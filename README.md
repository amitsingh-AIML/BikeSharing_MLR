## General Information
- Bike sharing LR model to predict demand in bike sharing and indentify key features.
- Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
- How well those variables describe the bike demands
- day.csv is being used.



## Conclusions
- Temparature has the highest linearity with bike demands. Business can use this info to create informed decisions.
- The r2 score for both test and train data are similar so this seems to be a decent model
- The bike demand is high in fall and so the month of September,OCT shows high demand. Offrs can be given in other seasons
- Clear weather is also indicator of high demand of bikes . Business can focus on giving offers when weather is not clear
- Monday and Weekends mainly Friday and Saturday the demand is high as well. Business can give offers on tuesday , wednesdays and thursday
